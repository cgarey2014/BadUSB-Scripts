## üìú Description

This directory contains various **BadUSB scripts** designed to extract sensitive information, specifically saved **passwords** from browsers and systems running Windows. These scripts can be executed on a target machine via USB devices like Flipper Zero or Rubber Ducky. The extracted passwords are typically exfiltrated to a remote location for further analysis, such as uploading to an SSH server or sending them via Discord Webhook.

Each script in this directory serves a specific purpose in credential harvesting, and they can be used individually or as part of a red team engagement or penetration test.

2. **Deploy to BadUSB device**:
   - Flash the modified script onto your BadUSB device.

3. **Execute on Target System**:
   - Plug the USB device into the target system, and the script will execute automatically.

4. **Monitor the exfiltrated data**:
   - Check your remote server (SSH, Discord Webhook, etc.) for the exfiltrated passwords or keys.
