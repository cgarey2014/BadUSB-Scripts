## üìú Description

The **Windows Key Extractor** is a BadUSB payload designed to extract the Windows product key from a target machine and send it to a specified Discord server channel. This script utilizes PowerShell to query the system's licensing service and retrieve the product key. The key is then exfiltrated by making a POST request to a Discord Webhook URL, allowing for quick and covert extraction of valuable system information.
